% If you have a file called "university-logo-filename.xxx", where xxx
% is a graphic format that can be processed by latex or pdflatex,

% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\section{Motivation}


\begin{frame}{Make Titles Informative. Use Uppercase Letters.}{Subtitles are optional.}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Use \texttt{itemize} a lot.
  \item
    Use very short sentences or short phrases.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Make Titles Informative.}

  You can create overlays\dots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item using the \texttt{pause} command:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      First item.
      \pause
    \item    
      Second item.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    using overlay specifications:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<3->
      First item.
    \item<4->
      Second item.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    using the general \texttt{uncover} command:
    \begin{itemize}
      \uncover<5->{\item
        First item.}
      \uncover<6->{\item
        Second item.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}

  % Keep the summary *very short*.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \alert{first main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    The \alert{second main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    Perhaps a \alert{third message}, but not more than that.
  \end{itemize}
  
  % The following outlook is optional.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Something you haven't solved.
